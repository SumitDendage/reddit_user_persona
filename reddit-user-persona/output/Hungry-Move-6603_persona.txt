Productive weekend activities in LKO?
[removed]

Everyone is something in LKO
Born and raised in Delhi - I shifted to LKO in Dec 24 for business purposes. I have hardly seen a car which does not have a sticker on it - everyone is uttar pradesh sarkar, adhiwakta, nyay palika, mahamantri, skoda laura, adrak lsson. 


What is the obsession peeps. 

Reddit Comments:
I was caught without helmet and license (close to my home). Cops outright wanted to fine me, but a 'common guy' came in and discussed bribe on my behalf with cops. I gave him 200rs (back in 2011) and Cops let me go.

He was not a common man. He was their agent and shield. If I or anyone recorded myself handiing them money I would be in prison for 10 years, i am sure. In fact we would have been released in a few weeks.

I am a huge supporter of LKO and would love to be part of the group. 

I have been following this group for a few years now. Everyone has a unique perspective and their lives are different. All I want is a chance to express my opinions. I am not a good communicator. 

I am a big fan of LKO and love to talk to people about it.
